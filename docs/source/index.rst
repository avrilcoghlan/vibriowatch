Vibriowatch
=========== 

**Vibriowatch** is a `PathogenWatch`_ database for *V. cholerae*. Vibriowatch contains `>4000` published *V. cholerae* genomes, and manually-curated metadata from the literature such as place, date and source of isolation; and phenotypic data for biotype, serogroup, serotype and antimicrobial resistance.

Vibriowatch is aimed for use by clinicians and public health workers studying cholera outbreaks, as well as for research biologists investigating *V. cholerae*.

Given raw genome sequencing reads, or a genome assembly for a bacterial isolate, key questions that can be answered using Vibriowatch include (**click on the links below for a short guide for those in a hurry**): 

1. `Is my isolate Vibrio cholerae? <https://vibriowatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assemblies.html#short-guide-for-those-in-a-hurry-is-my-isolate-vibrio-cholerae>`_

2. `Does my isolate belong to the current pandemic lineage of Vibrio cholerae? <https://vibriowatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mlst.html#short-guide-for-those-in-a-hurry-does-my-isolate-belong-to-the-current-pandemic-lineage>`_

3. What is the predicted antimicrobial resistance profile of my isolate? 

4. `Is my isolate predicted to produce cholera toxin (Ctx)? >https://vibriowatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/virulence.html#short-guide-for-those-in-a-hurry-does-my-isolate-express-cholera-toxin>`_

5. `Is my isolate closely related to other sequenced Vibrio cholerae isolates? <https://vibriowatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/closerelatives.html#short-guide-for-those-in-a-hurry-is-my-isolate-closely-related-to-other-sequenced-vibrio-cholerae-isolates>`_

In this tutorial we'll introduce the *V. cholerae* genomic data; explain how you can upload your own sequencing reads or genome assembly to Vibriowatch; and tell you about bioinformatics analyses you can carry out in Vibriowatch of your isolates and existing *V. cholerae* genomes in Vibriowatch. The table of contents is below, or to the left.
