*Vibrio cholerae* genomic data
==============================

In this section, we will describe:

* `The Vibrio cholerae reference genome`_.
* `What genomic data is available for Vibrio cholerae`_.

The Vibrio cholerae reference genome
------------------------------------

The *Vibrio cholerae* genome was first sequenced by `Heidelberg et al 2000`_. They sequenced strain N16961, which belongs to the current pandemic lineage (7PET lineage). They found that the genome is four Megabase and consists of two circular chromosomes, a larger chromosome of about three Megabase and a smaller chromosome of about 1.1 Megabase. Together, these two chromosomes have about 4000 genes, and their GC content of the chromosomes is about 47%.

It's worth bearing in mind that N16961 is the reference strain, but there may be a wide variety of genomic variation in the *V. cholerae population* worldwide. Some interesting examples have already been reported. `Johnson et al 2015`_ reported a *V. cholerae* isolate that has the two chromosomes fused into one big chromosome. `Okada et al 2015`_ reported an isolate with a third replicon of nearly one Megabase so that its genome size was five Megabase. As we sequence more and more genomes of *V. cholorae* isolates, we are likely to see more and more genomic variation.
