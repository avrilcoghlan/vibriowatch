The Haiti 2022 outbreak
-----------------------

You may already know that in January 2010 there was a catastrophic earthquake in Haiti, an island in the Caribbean.
Later that year, in October 2010, a huge cholera outbreak begain in Haiti, that lasted up until 2019, and included
more than 820,000 cholera cases and nearly 10,000 deaths from cholera. This outbreak was found to have been caused
by the current pandemic lineage of *Vibrio cholerae* (known as the 7PET lineage), and evidence suggests that it
was likely carried from Nepal to Haiti in 2010 (`Orata et al 2014`_).

By 2019, the number of cholera cases had waned off, and it appeared that the cholera epidemic in Haiti was finally over.
No more cholera cases were reported in Haiti in 2020, 2021 and for most of 2022. As a result, the Haitian government
was keen for Haiti be declared 'cholera-free'. However, unfortunately in October of 2022 a new cholera outbreak 
occurred in Haiti, after almost three years of no cholera cases. By February 2023, there had been more than 30,000
cholera cases, and >500 deaths from cholera (source: Pan American Health Organisation).

An important epidemiological question was: where did the *V. cholerae* causing the Haiti 2022 outbreak come from?
Had it persisted in Haiti since the previous 2010-2019 epidemic, persisting either in humans (e.g. asymptomatic or unreported cases)
or in the environment (e.g. in rivers or lakes)?

The H22 genome
--------------

Late in 2022, `Rubin et al 2022`_ published the genome of a *V. cholerae* isolate from the Haiti 2022 outbreak, which
they named isolate 'H22'.

In this worked example, I'm going to show you how to analyse the H22 genome to answer some key questions relevant
to public health, and answer questions about the origins of the Haiti 2022 outbreak:




Vibriowatch uses the IncTyper tool to identify plasmids in *Vibrio cholerae* genomes.
If no plasmids are predicted in the genome of an isolate, you will see this in the 'Plasmid Inc types'
section of its report page:

An example of an isolate with a predicted plasmid is RC9, which was isolated in Kenya in 1985.
Here is the 'Plasmid Inc types' section of its report page in Vibriowatch:

  :width: 650
  
This shows that this isolate is predicted by Vibriowatch to have a IncC-type plasmid.
