The Haiti 2022 outbreak
-----------------------

You may already know that in January 2010 there was a catastrophic earthquake in Haiti, an island in the Caribbean.
Later that year, in October 2010, a huge cholera outbreak begain in Haiti, that lasted up until 2019, and included
more than 820,000 cholera cases and nearly 10,000 deaths from cholera. This outbreak was found to have been caused
by the current pandemic lineage of *Vibrio cholerae* (known as the 7PET lineage), and evidence suggests that it
was likely carried from Nepal to Haiti in 2010 (`Orata et al 2014`_). 

.. _Orata et al 2014: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24699938/

By 2019, the number of cholera cases had waned off, and it appeared that the cholera epidemic in Haiti was finally over.
No more cholera cases were reported in Haiti in 2020, 2021 and for most of 2022. As a result, the Haitian government
was keen for Haiti be declared 'cholera-free'. However, unfortunately in October of 2022 a new cholera outbreak 
occurred in Haiti, after almost three years of no cholera cases. By February 2023, there had been more than 30,000
cholera cases, and >500 deaths from cholera (source: Pan American Health Organisation).

An important epidemiological question was: where did the *V. cholerae* causing the Haiti 2022 outbreak come from?
Had it persisted in Haiti since the previous 2010-2019 epidemic, persisting either in humans (e.g. asymptomatic or unreported cases)
or in the environment (e.g. in rivers or lakes)?

The H22 genome
--------------

Late in 2022, `Rubin et al 2022`_ published the genome of a *V. cholerae* isolate from the Haiti 2022 outbreak, which
they named isolate 'H22'. 

.. _Rubin et al 2022: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36449726/

In this worked example, I'm going to show you how to analyse the H22 genome to answer some key questions relevant
to public health, and answer questions about the origins of the Haiti 2022 outbreak:

#. Does H22 belong to the pandemic lineage of Vibrio cholerae?
#. What are the closest relatives of H22 among published Vibrio cholerae genomes? 
#. What can we say about the origins of the Haiti 2022 outbreak, based on the H22 genome?
#. Is H22 predicted to produce cholera toxin?
#. Is H22 predicted to have antimicrobial resistance?
#. Is H22 predicted to have plasmids?

Let's analyse the H22 genome in Vibriowatch to answer some of these questions. The H22
genome is amongst the approximately 6000 genomes that we have already added to Vibriowatch as 'public' genomes that
everyone can see. 

First, let's find the H22 genome in Vibriowatch.

You can search for an isolate in Vibriowatch by searching by its isolate/strain name(s).

You can search for isolate H22 in Vibriowatch by clicking on the three small horizontal bars at the top left of the Pathogenwatch website:

This will bring up a menu:

.. image:: Picture10.png
  :width: 150
  
If you click on 'All Genomes' in the menu, you will then see a list of all the genomes in Pathogenwatch. 

To just select *V. cholerae* genomes, click on 'Genus' in the menu that now appears:

.. image:: Picture22.png

Then select 'Vibrio', to select just genomes from *V. cholerae*. You will now see a list of the approximately 6000 *V. cholerae* genomes (just showing the top of the list here):

A search bar will now appear at the top left.
If you type 'HCUF' in the search bar, it will find isolate HCUF_01:

You can click on the isolate's name (link 'H22') to go to its 'report page'. 
The report page shows the curated metadata for the isolate, as well as bioinformatics analyses of the isolate.
This shows the top of the report page for H22:
