I would like here to acknowledge the great help and work of my colleagues at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, especially Dr Matthew Dorman, Dr Florent Lassalle, Dr Sina Beier, Dr Alyce Taylor-Brown, Dr Adrian Cazares, Sam Dougan, and Prof. Nicholas Thomson, and all of the Thomson group.

Thank you also to our fantastic collaborators Dr Corin Yeats and Prof. David Aanensen who have developed Pathogenwatch at the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, and have extensively adapted it for Vibriowatch.

Thank you to Dr Josefina Campos (INEI-ANLIS Malbran, Argentina),
Dr Neelam Taneja and Nisha Singh (PGIMER Chandigarh, India), 
and Dr Yann Boucher (National University of Singapore),
who have advised us on Vibriowatch.

Lastly, but very importantly, we would
like to say thank you to our funders who have funded our work. These are the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and also the University of Oxford, Wellcome Trust, and Wellcome Sanger Institute.
